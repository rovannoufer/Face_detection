# Face_detection
 Python script that demonstrates real-time face tracking using a deep learning model. 
 The program employs computer vision techniques and TensorFlow to build a custom face tracking model that can detect and track faces in live webcam streams.

Key Features:

Data Collection: The script captures a sequence of images from the webcam to build a dataset for face tracking training.

Data Augmentation: It enhances the dataset with augmented images and corresponding bounding box annotations, improving model generalization.

Model Building: The custom face tracking model is built using a combination of VGG16-based feature extraction and unique classification and localization branches.

Loss Functions: Custom loss functions, including binary cross-entropy and localization loss, are implemented to optimize the model.

Training Loop: The script defines a custom training loop with TensorFlow for model training and evaluation.

Real-Time Face Tracking: Utilizing the trained model, the script captures live webcam frames and overlays bounding boxes and labels around detected faces in real time.

User Interaction: The program responds to user input ('q' key) for a convenient and interactive experience.

The script showcases expertise in data preprocessing, model architecture design, custom loss functions, and real-time computer vision applications. It serves as a practical implementation of face tracking using deep learning, enabling developers to understand and apply these techniques in their own projects.
